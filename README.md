# Automatic Fire Fighting Robot Using IoT

This project is an Automatic Fire Fighting Robot designed to detect and extinguish fires autonomously using IoT technology. The robot is programmed using Arduino and integrates sensors and actuators to perform fire detection and suppression.

## Features

- Fire detection using sensors
- Automatic movement towards fire source
- Water pump activation for fire extinguishing
- IoT integration for remote monitoring and control
- Real-time status updates

## Hardware Components

- Arduino board(UNO)
- Flame sensor
- Water pump
- Motor driver
- IoT module (e.g., ESP8266/ESP32)
- Chassis and wheels
- Power supply

## Software

- Arduino IDE
- Automatic_Fire_Fighting_robot_Code.ino (main code)

## How It Works

1. The flame sensor detects fire in the environment.
2. The robot moves towards the fire source.
3. Once near the fire, the water pump is activated to extinguish the fire.
4. IoT module sends status updates to a remote dashboard.

## Setup Instructions

1. Assemble the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the `Automatic_Fire_Fighting_robot_Code.ino` to the Arduino board using Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the IoT module and configure Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
4. Power on the robot and monitor its status via the IoT dashboard.
